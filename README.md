# Anima Verse

A full-stack web application for creating, configuring and interacting with AI-powered virtual characters ("agents"). It combines a Python/FastAPI backend and a vanilla JavaScript frontend.

> **⚠ Alpha — vibe-coded experiment.** This project is an experiment in how far one can push a small LLM-driven game / character simulator built with massive AI assistance ("vibe coding") rather than a traditional engineering process. Most of the code was written interactively with an LLM in the loop. **It has so far only been tested by a single person on a single setup.** Expect rough edges, inconsistent error handling, undocumented assumptions about your hardware/providers, and breaking changes between commits. Bug reports and patches are welcome — production use is not.

> **What sets it apart.** Unlike chat-centric frontends (e.g. SillyTavern) where image generation is an optional add-on, Anima Verse leans on **both LLM chat and LLM-driven image generation as first-class, deeply integrated mechanics** — characters update their location, activity and outfit through tool calls, every scene can be rendered, mood drives expression, the world map shows what each character is currently doing. The experiment is to see what kind of "living world" emerges when both modalities are pushed that hard at the same time. The author hasn't seen another open-source project doing this in this combination yet.

> **⚠ Adult / NSFW content.** Anima Verse is a generic creative-writing and character-simulation framework. The bundled demo world, character templates and image-analysis prompt are SFW. **However, the system was designed flexibly: a user can author their own NSFW character templates, prompt the LLM into adult content, point the image-generation backends at adult-tuned models, etc.** Whether the framework is used for entirely innocuous storytelling or for explicit content is a choice made by each user when configuring their own setup. The author does not provide adult content with this project, and is not responsible for content users produce while running it. Users are responsible for complying with local laws and with the acceptable-use policies of any third-party services (LLM providers, image-generation APIs) they configure.

## Installation

### Ubuntu 24.04 tested (Proxmox LXC Container)

#### Prerequisites

1. **LLM Provider**
   - Ollama (tested)
   - OpenAI
   - llama-swap (tested)
   - Any OpenAI-compatible API
2. **(Optional) Image Generation**
   - Stable Diffusion WebUI (A1111/Forge) with `--listen --api` flags
   - ComfyUI
   - Mammouth AI (or similar cloud service)
3. **(Optional) SearX** (e.g. SearXNG) for web search
4. **(Optional) TTS Service** - XTTS v2, F5-TTS or Magpie
5. **(Optional) ComfyUI** for image animation (Wan2.2 img2video workflow)

6. Install system dependencies:
```bash
apt update
apt install git python3.12-venv
apt install -y build-essential python3-dev ffmpeg
```

#### Clone project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kaix76/anima-verse.git
```

#### Create virtual Python environment
```bash
cd anima-verse
python3 -m venv .venv

# Linux/Mac (bash/zsh):
source .venv/bin/activate

# fish shell:
source .venv/bin/activate.fish

# Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -e .
```

#### Download models
The large model binaries are not committed to the repo. Fetch them with (run
**after** `pip install -e .`):
```bash
./fetch_models.sh
```
This downloads `u2net.onnx` (background removal for outfit previews and world/map
images) and the built-in embedding model `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` (pose matching,
via `fastembed`). The script is idempotent (skips files that already exist) and
verifies checksums. The embedding model otherwise auto-downloads on first use, so
this step is optional — but it makes the first run offline-capable and predictable.

#### Configuration

There is no `.env` file. Configuration is per-world (under `worlds/<world>/config.json`) and is filled in **after** the first start through the admin UI at `/admin/settings`. The full step-by-step setup is covered in [Getting Started with a New World](#getting-started-with-a-new-world) below.

---

## Storage

Each **world** is a self-contained directory under `worlds/`. Multiple worlds can co-exist (e.g. one per household / user / experiment) and are selected at startup with `--world NAME`.

All structured data lives in **two SQLite databases per world**:

- `world.db` — account, characters, character state, locations/rooms/activities, items, inventory, outfits, memories, knowledge, relationships, mood/state history, summaries, notifications, events, scheduler jobs/logs, group chats, story arcs, model capabilities, secrets, ...
- `task_queue.db` — persistent task queue (image generation, LLM jobs, animations)

Everything else on disk is either configuration or binary content (images, audio).

```
worlds/{world-name}/
  world.db                    # Primary data store (see above)
  task_queue.db               # Persistent task queue
  config.json                 # Per-world config: LLM providers, image backends, ...
  secrets.json                # API keys / passwords (gitignored, overlaid on config.json at load)
  characters/{Name}/
    gallery/                  # Curated profile and variant images
    images/                   # Generated gallery images
    outfits/                  # Rendered outfit images
    skills/                   # Per-skill config + extraction caches
    scheduler/                # Job run logs
    soul/                     # Soul / core identity (markdown)
  instagram/                  # Per-character Instagram posts (images + caption sidecars)
  stories/                    # Rendered story scene stills
  world_gallery/              # Generated location / room background images
  chat_uploads/               # User-uploaded images in chat
  tmp/                        # Temporary files (TTS audio, story stills, ...)
```

Cross-world resources (read-only, shared by every world) live in:

```
shared/
  templates/
    character/                # Character templates: human-default, human-roleplay, animal, ...
    expression/               # Facial expression presets for image generation
    pose/                     # Pose presets for image generation
    soul/                     # Soul / personality templates
  config/                     # Language packs and other static config
  world_dev_schemas/          # JSON Schemas used by the world-dev UI
  items/                      # Global item catalog (merged with per-world items)
  activities/                 # Global activity definitions
```

### Selecting a world

```bash
./start.sh                    # opens the bundled demo world (./worlds/demo)
./start.sh --world myworld    # opens (or creates) ./worlds/myworld
./start.sh --storage /path    # custom path anywhere on disk
```

The repository ships with a pre-populated `demo/` world as a starter. To begin from a clean slate, pass `--world <new-name>` — the directory is created automatically on first start.

## Getting Started with a New World

Walk-through for setting up a fresh world from zero.

> If a step is unclear, have a look at [`docs/images/getting-started/`](docs/images/getting-started/) — a few annotated screenshots are kept there for reference. They are not linked inline, since UIs evolve faster than screenshots.

1. **Start the server with a brand-new world name.** Pick any name that does not yet exist under `worlds/`:

   ```bash
   ./start.sh --world myworld
   ```

   Expected on first start: a warning `Config file not found: …/worlds/myworld/config.json — using empty config`. The server boots anyway; everything else is configured through the Admin UI.

2. **Log in as the bootstrap admin.** Open `http://<host>:8000/` in a browser and log in with the credentials printed in the startup log:

   ```
   username: admin
   password: admin1234
   ```

   Change this password immediately under `/admin/users` — the bootstrap credentials are intentionally trivial and not safe for any real deployment.

3. **Configure server-side settings.** Go to `http://<host>:8000/admin/settings` and work through the sections from top to bottom. The minimum you need before anything else functions:

   - **Server** — set a real `JWT Secret`
   - **LLM Providers** — at least one provider (Ollama, OpenAI, llama-swap, ...) with `name`, `type`, `api_base`, GPU/VRAM info
   - **LLM Routing** — map the built-in tasks (`chat`, `tools`, `summarize`, `vision`, ...) to a provider + model
   - *(optional but recommended)* **Image Backends**, **TTS**, **Beszel** — only required for the corresponding features

   API keys, the JWT secret, passwords and similar fields are written to a separate **`secrets.json`** next to `config.json`. That file is gitignored, so the bundled demo world can ship with an empty `config.json` and each user fills in their own keys after cloning.

4. **Create your first character.** Character creation lives in the main UI, not in `/admin/settings`. After saving the admin settings, navigate back to the home page (`http://<host>:8000/`).

   In the header above the (still empty) character portrait you will find a **`➕ New`** button — that is the entry point. The flow:

   1. Click `➕ New`.
   2. Pick a template, e.g. **Human (Roleplay)** for a typical chat partner. Other templates: `Human (Default)`, `Animal (Default)`, plus any you have added under `shared/templates/character/`.
   3. Enter a name (e.g. `Damian Demo`).
   4. The character editor opens directly on the new character so you can start filling in appearance, personality, outfits, etc.

   The character is automatically added to the creator's `allowed_characters`, so you do not need to step through `/admin/users` to grant yourself access.

5. **Fill in the character profile.** With the editor open, work through the fields top to bottom. Most are template-driven and roughly self-explanatory; a few notes:

   - The **Soul tab** holds the character's inner life (personality, beliefs, goals, lessons, soul, tasks, roleplay rules) as plain markdown files under `worlds/<world>/characters/<Name>/soul/`. Save in the editor or edit the `.md` files directly — both work.
   - **Appearance** has two prompts: `character_appearance` (full body, used for gallery / outfits) and `Face Prompt` (head only, used for the profile image). The token preview underneath each shows the resolved string.
   - **Language** is per-character — it controls what language the model is instructed to respond in.

6. **Set a profile image.** Two ways:

   - **Generate one:** with at least one Image Generation backend configured (and `face_appearance` filled), click the camera icon (📷) in the header — the system uses the Face Prompt to generate a fresh portrait. Re-clicking generates a new one.
   - **Upload one:** open the character's gallery, upload an image, then mark it as the profile image. Useful when you have a reference photo or a curated render you want to reuse — it skips the generation step entirely.

   The profile image is used as the reference for later generations so the
   character keeps a consistent face. Any face matching / post-processing beyond
   that is handled by a separate external service (see Image Generation above).

7. **Take over the character as your avatar.** Once a character has a profile image and a filled-in profile, you can step into them as the player. In the header you'll see an `active-character` dropdown — pick the character. From this point on, that character is *you*: their location, mood and outfit follow your decisions, and they no longer act autonomously.

   Templates differ in whether they expose this option: `human-roleplay`, `human-roleplay-nsfw` and `animal-default` carry the `playable_avatar` flag and can be controlled. `human-default` does not — it is meant strictly for NPCs / chat partners.

8. **Create at least one more character to talk to.** A roleplay world with a single character means chatting with yourself, which is not particularly interesting. Repeat step 4 to add at least one more — common patterns:

   - A second **Roleplay** character (also `playable_avatar`) — useful if you ever want to switch sides.
   - A **Human (Default)** character — a pure NPC. They cannot be the player avatar but show up in chats, social interactions, group chats etc.

   After creating the new character, the system automatically sets them as your chat partner if they are the only "other" available. Otherwise pick them in the chat-partner UI.

9. **Build the world map.** Open the world editor and add at least one location (e.g. "Café", "Park"). The flow:

   1. Click **`+ New Location`**, give it a name and a short description, save.
   2. Once the location appears in the **locations list**, select it — the room editor unlocks. Add one or more **rooms** (e.g. for a café: "Main room", "Terrace"). Rooms are where activities happen and where characters actually spend time; a location without rooms exists on the map but cannot host activities.
   3. Add **activities** per room (e.g. "drinking coffee", "people-watching", "working_on_computer", "cooking", "sleeping"). They show up as options for characters at that room and are picked by the LLM via the `set_activity` skill.
   4. Optionally fill the **image prompts** (day / night / map). Background image generation runs **asynchronously in the background** — you can keep editing the next location, the image will appear in the gallery once the queue picks it up. No need to sit and wait for ComfyUI / Together to finish.

   Repeat for each location your characters should be able to be in.

10. **Position the location on the world map.** In the world editor, the map view shows every location as a draggable card. Drag-and-drop sets `grid_x` / `grid_y` — saved automatically on drop. Characters on the map move between adjacent cells, so positions are not just cosmetic.

11. **(Optional) Gate a room behind an item.** Useful for rooms that should only be accessible to specific characters — bedrooms, locked storage, hidden areas. Open the **🎮 Game Admin** button in the header (admin only) and:

    1. **Items tab → `+ New`** — create the gating item (e.g. a key). Give it a clear ID like `key_room_506`. In the same dialog, scroll down to **Owners** and assign the item to the character(s) who should be able to enter.
    2. **Rules tab → `+ New`** — define the access rule:
       - **Scope:** `All characters`
       - **Subject:** `Location / Room`
       - **Action:** `Enter`
       - **Location** + **Room** — pick the gated room
       - **Condition:** `NOT has_item:key_room_506`
    3. Save. From now on, only characters who own that item can enter the room. The set-location skill, the move-on-map flow and any LLM-driven location change all consult these rules.

12. **Pick the right chat mode for your character.** The character's `chat_mode` (in the editor under *Behavior*) controls how skills like `set_location`, `set_activity`, `change_outfit` are invoked during chat — and which one you choose **must match the tool-calling ability of your chat model**:

    - **`single`** — the chat LLM itself emits the tool calls inline with its response. Requires a chat model with **reliable, structured tool-call output** (e.g. raw Mixtral-Instruct, Qwen-Instruct without an RP fine-tune, GPT-4-class, Claude, Llama-3.x-Instruct). One LLM call, fast, but breaks silently on RP fine-tunes that produce only prose.
    - **`rp_first`** *(Recommended for RP fine-tunes)* — the chat LLM answers narratively first ("I'm on my way to the café…"), then a separate Tool LLM reads that text and translates it into concrete skill calls. Two LLM calls per turn, slightly slower, but the chat stays in character and you can pair an RP fine-tune (Valkyrie, Sao10K, Anubis, …) with a tool-capable Helper model behind it.

    **Symptom of the wrong mode:** the character agrees ("I'll come over") but their `current_location` / `current_activity` never actually changes — no `set_location` was emitted. If you see this, switch the character to `rp_first` and route a tool-capable model to the Tools tasks (`/admin/settings → LLM Routing`).

13. **(Optional) Configure the Messaging Frame.** `/admin/settings → Messaging Frame (Phone Chat Layout)` lets you wrap the chat in a phone-style frame (status bar, rounded corners, etc.) — useful when you want the conversation to feel like a chat app rather than a generic web UI. Pick a frame preset, save, and reload the chat page.

From here on you have a working setup: chat with the character, watch them move on the world map, take over a character as your avatar, run a group chat. The remaining features (Instagram feed, story arcs, scheduler, knowledge extraction, …) are documented in their respective admin sections — see the **Features** section above for a complete list.
