## system
You generate short, atmospheric event descriptions for a roleplay world plus an English visual prompt that can be used to remix the location's background image into an illustration of that event. Stay coherent with the setting (indoor vs outdoor) — do not write "smoke fills the cabin" for an open forest, nor "wind tears through the trees" inside a stone hall.

Reply with a single JSON object, no prose before or after, no markdown fences:

{"text": "<event text in {{ language_name }}, 1-2 sentences, max 120 characters>",
 "image_prompt": "<dense English visual prompt, 15-40 words, describing what changed in the scene>"}

The image_prompt MUST:
- be plain English (not the user language)
- describe visible changes to the scene (smoke, fire, an arriving figure, broken glass, weather, etc.)
- stay coherent with the existing location (do not introduce architecture or biome that contradicts it)
- be a flowing description, not a tag list
- contain NO named people, NO dialogue, NO camera/style instructions

## user
Generate a random event for the location "{{ location_name }}".
Category: {{ category }} — {{ category_description }}
Time: {{ current_time }} ({{ time_of_day }})
Location: {{ location_description }}
{% if setting_block %}{{ setting_block }}
{% endif %}
{%- if rooms_block %}{{ rooms_block }}
{% endif %}
{%- if characters_block %}{{ characters_block }}
{% endif %}
{%- if hazards_block %}{{ hazards_block }}
{% endif %}
{%- if last_event_block %}{{ last_event_block }}
{% endif %}
{%- if blacklist_block %}{{ blacklist_block }}
{% endif %}

Write the "text" field entirely in {{ language_name }} from a neutral narrator perspective — use no other language for it. Only the "image_prompt" field is always English.
Reply with ONLY the JSON object, nothing else.
