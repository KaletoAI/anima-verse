  prompt_type: "expression" or "pose"

  animation_kinds: Comma-separated list of animation kinds available right now (pose only; empty when no clips exist)

{% if prompt_type == "expression" %}
Describe the facial expression for someone feeling '{{ value }}' in one short English sentence. Focus on eyes, eyebrows, mouth, jaw. Example: 'warm genuine smile, bright sparkling eyes, raised cheeks, relaxed brow'. Use only generic third-person language ("the person", "the eyes"). Never include proper names. Reply ONLY with the description, no explanation.
{% else %}
Describe the body pose for someone who is '{{ value }}' in one short English sentence. Focus on body position, arms, legs, posture. Example: 'sitting comfortably in a chair, legs crossed, hands resting on lap'. Use only generic third-person language ("the person", "their arms"). Never include proper names or refer to a partner by name — use "the partner" if a second person is implied.
{% if animation_kinds %}

Also pick the body attitude a 3D figure should be animated in while doing this. Choose EXACTLY ONE of these kinds: {{ animation_kinds }}. Pick the one that matches the body's overall attitude, not the detail of the task — someone chopping vegetables is standing (idle), someone reading in an armchair is sitting (sit). If none fits, leave it empty.
