Generate a subtle event hint about a secret.
Location: {{ location_name }}
The hidden secret belongs to {{ target_character }}: "{{ secret_content }}"
Observers at this location: {{ observers_list }}

Rules:
- Do NOT reveal the secret directly.
- Write a 1-2 sentence event that could make {{ observers_list }} suspicious.
- Subtle clue, ambiguous sign — leaves room for interpretation.
- Write the event text in {{ language_name }} — no other language. Max 140 characters.
- Reply with ONLY the event text, nothing else.
