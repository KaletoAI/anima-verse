{# Slim system prompt for the continuous AgentLoop.
   Sections only render when their block has content (pre-decided in
   app/core/thought_context.py). Blocks are ordered by priority — higher
   priority comes first because LLMs weight earlier context more heavily.

   Required:
     character_name, personality, location_name, activity, feeling,
     time_of_day, has_assignments

   Optional pre-formatted blocks (omit / empty string to skip):
     effects_block             — active status modifiers (drunk, exhausted, …)
     outfit_self_block         — own equipped outfit summary (situation line)
     present_people_block      — characters at the same location
     inbox_block               — High prio: unread chat-history messages
     events_block              — High prio: acute events at location
     assignments_block         — Medium: active assignments
     general_task              — Medium: static profile task
     commitments_block         — Medium: open promises
     outfit_decision_block     — High when triggered (after location-change or wake)
     instagram_pending_block   — Medium: recent Instagram posts within window
     inventory_block           — what the character is carrying
     room_items_block          — visible items in the current room
     available_activities_block — activities possible at current location
     daily_schedule_block      — typical-rhythm hint for current hour
     surroundings_block        — 4 orthogonally adjacent grid tiles (Move targets)
     known_locations_block     — visibility-filtered list of places to go
     travel_block              — active journey info (target + remaining steps)
     tracker_block             — carried tracker-items revealing target locations
     arc_block                 — Low: active story arc context
     retrospective_block       — Low (with boost): "time to reflect"
     tools_hint                — tool-format hint for single-mode tool use
