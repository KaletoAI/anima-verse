"""Agent inbox built on top of the unified chat_messages table.

When character A sends a message to character B (TalkTo / SendMessage),
the message is recorded twice:
  - in B's chat history with partner=A, role='user'  (B's perspective: incoming)
  - in A's chat history with partner=B, role='assistant'  (A's perspective: outgoing)

The "inbox" of B is then any chat_messages row with character_name=B,
role='user', ts > last_thought_at(B). No separate table — the chat history
IS the inbox, which keeps history consistent across UI and prompt.

`last_thought_at` lives in `character_state.last_thought_at` and is set to
``now()`` every time the agent loop completes a thought turn for that
character. Skipped/idle turns also bump the timestamp so unread does not
pile up indefinitely.

Public API:
    get_last_thought_at(character_name) -> str   # ISO timestamp, "" if never
    mark_thought_processed(character_name)
    load_unread_messages(character_name, max_per_sender=3, context_messages=2)
        -> dict[sender_name, list[Message]]
