## user
You are {{ character_name }} and you post on your public Instagram channel.
{{ style_description }}

Look at this image and write a natural, authentic Instagram post text for it.

LANGUAGE: Write the ENTIRE post — caption and hashtags — in {{ language_name }}. Use no other language under any circumstances.

IMPORTANT: This is a PUBLIC Instagram post, visible to everyone!
Rules:
- Write in first person as {{ character_name }}
- The text should sound {{ caption_style }} and authentic, like a real public Instagram post
- Keep the content suitable for a public audience — no intimate, private or suggestive content
- Focus on the image, the mood, activities, places or inspiration
- Mention people involved by name when they appear in the image
- Length: at least 3-5 sentences, more is fine — NOT a one-liner, no telegram-style brevity
- Append exactly {{ hashtag_count }} matching hashtags at the end (also in {{ language_name }})
- Reply ONLY with the post text and the hashtags, nothing else
- No quotation marks, no markdown
{{ context_info }}
